# makerthon2020
Code base for NUS Makerthon 2020

## Running the app
On CLI:
`meteor npm install`

`meteor`

## Packages used
These are the packaged I installed using `meteor npm install` or `meteor add` that I used in the code
- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
- [Headless-chrome-crawler]
- [Puppeteer]
- [Cheerio]

## Extensions
Do if we have time (not as necessary)
1. A chat page for the accounts since we want them to actually connect with each other
2. Some kind of reminder for them to attend (not kiosk)
3. Integrate scraper with front-end


#### Account Considerations
- How to add Friends?
- Possible to filter events by location/their friends?

##### Future Developement
- Removed developement firebase auth key, do associate a personal one and remember to not commit the keys into the repo!
